# Collinear Points
Solution to the Collinear Points assignment.

## Summary
Computer vision involves analyzing patterns in visual images and reconstructing the real-world objects that produced them. The process is often broken up into two phases: feature detection and pattern recognition. Feature detection involves selecting important features of the image; pattern recognition involves discovering patterns in the features. We will investigate a particularly clean pattern recognition problem involving points and line segments. This kind of pattern recognition arises in many other applications such as statistical data analysis.

## The Problem
Given a set of n distinct points in the plane, find every (maximal) line segment that connects a subset of 4 or more of the points.
