# Queues
Solution to the Queues assignment.

## Summary
The goal of this assignment is to implement elementary data structures using arrays and linked lists, and to introduce generics and iterators.

## Deque
A double-ended queue or deque (pronounced “deck”) is a generalization of a stack and a queue that supports adding and removing items from either the front or the back of the data structure.

## Randomized Queue
A randomized queue is similar to a stack or queue, except that the item removed is chosen uniformly at random among items in the data structure.

## Specification
