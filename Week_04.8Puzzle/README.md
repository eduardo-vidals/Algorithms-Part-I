# 8 Puzzle
This is my solution to the 8Puzzle assignment. 

## Summary
The 8-puzzle is a sliding puzzle that is played on a 3-by-3 grid with 8 square tiles labeled 1 through 8, plus a blank square. The goal is to rearrange the tiles so that they are in row-major order, using as few moves as possible. You are permitted to slide tiles either horizontally or vertically into the blank square.

## The Problem
Write a program to solve the 8-puzzle problem (and its natural generalizations) using the A* search algorithm.
